### Plant NFT Market - README
## Introduction
TreesTogther is a decentralized web application that allows users to purchase and collect plant and tool NFTs, learn about agriculture, and earn rewards in TST tokens. The project is built on Ethereum blockchain using Truffle, Solidity, and React.

## Getting Started
# Prerequisites
To run the project, you will need to have the following installed on your system:

    Ganache: a personal blockchain for Ethereum development
    Node.js: an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment
# Installing
To install the dependencies required to run the project, run the following command in the terminal:
"npm install"
# Running the Project
To deploy the smart contracts on Ganache, run the following command in the terminal:
"truffle migrate --reset"

To start the React environment for the project, run the following command in the terminal:
"npm start"

## Usage
# Connecting to MetaMask
To use the application, users must have the MetaMask browser extension installed and connected to the local Ganache network. When users first access the site, they will be prompted to connect their MetaMask wallet.

# Purchasing and Collecting NFTs
Users can purchase and collect plant and tool NFTs on the main page of the application. Each NFT is unique and contains information about the plant or tool it represents, such as its DNA, rarity, and level. Users can level up their plants by using tools and earn rewards in TST tokens.

# Learning About Agriculture
Users can learn about agriculture by clicking on the buttons in the Plant Information section of the main page. Each button corresponds to a different plant and displays information about its agricultural impact, such as production emissions and carbon absorption.

Contacting the Website Owner
Users can contact the website owner by filling out the form on the Contact page of the application.

## Future Work
    Implement a marketplace for users to buy and sell plant and tool NFTs.
    Make TST tokens more useful in the application to increase participation in tokenomics.
    Improve the smart contract for plant NFTs to allow fully grown plants to generate new seed NFTs.
    Add a quiz page to test users' knowledge about blockchain and saving the environment and allow users to earn TST tokens by completing quizzes.
    Write a more detailed plan for integrating third parties, such as farm owners and government agencies, to start planting trees and taking action.
