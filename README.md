#Welcome to the readme file for our project!

To get started with our project, please make sure that you have installed Ganache and have it running. Ganache is a personal blockchain for Ethereum development, and it allows us to deploy and test our smart contracts in a local environment.

After installing Ganache, please run the quick start option to set up a new workspace. You can do this by selecting the "Quickstart" option on the home screen, and following the prompts.

Next, please make sure that you have all the dependencies specified in the package.json file installed. You can install these by running npm install in the terminal from the project directory.

Once you have Ganache running and all the dependencies installed, you can deploy the smart contracts by running truffle migrate --reset in the terminal from the project directory. This will compile and deploy the smart contracts to Ganache.

Finally, to start the React environment for the project, you can run npm start in the terminal from the project directory. This will start the development server and open the project in your default browser.

We hope you enjoy using our project, and please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or feedback!
